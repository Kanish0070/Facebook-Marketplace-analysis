The Facebook marketplace analysis model is used to predict/ selecting the optimonl way for sellers to select the distribtution form for their product(Video/photos/link/status).
The classsification model I used was K -Means clustering which is a Unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
I found that 2 was the optiminal number of groups to be splitted.
The result was found Video was best alligned for their distribution as it had more reach to all kind of people.
